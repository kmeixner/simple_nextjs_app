# simple nextjs app

This repository is a simple nextjs app for me to practice and use for reference as an example.

## Project Structure

- .next/ : (do not commit) a build output directory generated by Next.js when the application is run
- node_modules/ : (do not commit) generated Node modules (eg: npm install upper-case)
- index.html : the main app
- initial_react_app : the sample React App that we started from before converting it to NextJS
- package-lock.json : (should be committed) contains metadata about project and its dependencies
- package.json : (should be committed) ensures exact versions of all dependencies installed, for reproducible builds.
- README.md : this README file
