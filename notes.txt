1) npm install react@latest react-dom@latest next@latest
=> package.js and package-lock.js files are generated (note these SHOULD be committed to the git repository)

2) Add a "next dev" script to your package.json file:

add:
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev"
  },

=> package.json should look something like this afterwards (version may differ):

{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "next": "^14.0.3",
    "react": "^18.3.1",
    "react-dom": "^18.3.1"
  }
}

3) npm run dev
